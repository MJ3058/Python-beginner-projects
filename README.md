# hello-world
First repository to start practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am a newbie to the programming world, though can write a simple programm on Python language.
Want to understand how the Information Systems work alongside of writing code and commiting my skills to another programmers' works.
Ah, forgot to inrtoduce myself. My name is Mirjahon. MJ for short since not everyone can pronounce my name. I would rather prefer people calling me MJ, cause I don't like my name to be mispronounced. I feel weird.
I am 21 years old. Probably no need to mention this info but who cares. This repository is private anyways. Maybe I will use it as my diary. Hehe~. 21 years old lil' punk uses diaries. What a joke.
Why I am doing all that anyway? Well, I have to start from somewhere isn't it? People on the Internet recommend using this platform and it is by itself is pretty popular so why not to use it. I will need it anyway.
Okay let's conclude my introduction here. MJ, 21 y.o, likes to play video games and rarely read books. Can I call myself a geek or a nerd? Not really... ... ... Nice to meet you lot! xp
